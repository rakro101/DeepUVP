# DeepUVP
# First run with ZooScann Images

# Installation Guide
https://pytorch.org/get-started/locally/

```sh
brew install python@3.12
pip3 install torch torchvision torchaudio
pip3 install -r requirements.txt
```

# Usage
Additional Networks/ Architectures can be implemented in model_arc.
The dataloader is in dataloader.py.
The training logic loop is in loop.py defined.
The hyperparameter dicts in the config.py.

Set up an Weight and Biases Account: https://wandb.ai/site/

# Training - Data needed and computing power
Here i use an open source Zooscan dataset https://www.seanoe.org/data/00446/55741/
But we could use the dataloader from DeepLOKI aswell.

Training: Run main.py
Sweeps/Hyperparameter Tuning:  Run sweeps_main.py

# Software used
Training and Validation was performed on an Nvidia A$100$ (Nvidia Corp., Santa Clara, CA, USA) and on Apple M1 MAX with 32 GB (Apple, USA), depending on the computational power needed, for example self-supervised pre-training was performed on a Hyper performing cluster with Nvidia A$100$. <br>
On the Macbook Pro (Apple, USA) we used:<br>
